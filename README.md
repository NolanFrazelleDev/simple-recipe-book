# simple-recipe-book
This is an app that will keep track of recipes that I create. This is also will be other information such as server setup, db connections, and etc.

Overall, I want need to have a server that interacts with the database and requests
Inside of the database will be information that I enter manually through the ejs form. There will be pages dedicated to each recipe and then you can edit each thing that needs to be edited based on need, or delete the recipe entirely.
